ghostlinkd (0.30)

  * Added the ability to link using hard links if desired.  

  * Added additional messages in verbose mode.  Added a --report option, in
    order to be able to list where files are linked from when using hard
    links.  

  * Moved installation of watchers and event handlers so it is done before the
    initial scan of directory content, so as to not miss changes taking place
    during the initial scan.

  * Removed some nonfunctional options
