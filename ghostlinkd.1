.SH NAME
\fBghostlinkd \fP- Monitor and maintain an aggregate symlink directory.
\fB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBghostlinkd\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.fam T
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBghostlinkd\fP will first scan, and then continuously monitor a list of
source directories, in order to keep a target directory updated with
the aggregated content of the source directories, in priority order.
This is accomplished using one of the supported methods: symlinking,
.TP
.B
hardlinking, or rsyncing.
By default it goes to the background as a
daemon, but it can be made to run in the foreground.
.PP
In order to do its work it uses the inotify interface of Linux kernel
2.6.13 and later. It will not work if the inotify interface is absent.
.PP
Example: Let's say that you have the source directory list:
["/foo/a/", "/bar/b/", "/baz/c/"]; and a target directory "/fum/t/".
If the contents of the source directories are:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
            /foo/a/
                xx
                xy
                xz

            /bar/b/
                xx
                yy
                zz

            /baz/c/
                xy
                yy
                yz

.fam T
.fi
then the target directory will be made to contain the following:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
            /fum/t/
                xx -> /foo/a/xx
                xy -> /foo/a/xy
                xz -> /foo/a/xz
                yy -> /bar/b/yy
                yz -> /baz/c/yz
                zz -> /bar/b/zz

.fam T
.fi
Note that xx, which occurs in both /foo/a/ and /bar/b/, is linked to
/foo/a/ because that occurs before /bar/b/ in the source list; and in
the same manner, yy is linked to /bar/b/yy rather than /baz/c/yy
because /bar/b/ occurs before /baz/c/ in the source list.

.SH FILES
\fBghostlinkd\fP reads its configuration from the following files (if
found), in the given order:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
            <bin-dir>/ghostlinkd.conf
            /etc/ghostlinkd.conf
            /etc/ghostlinkd/ghostlinkd.conf
            ~/.ghostlinkdrc

.fam T
.fi
where <bin-dir> is the directory where \fBghostlinkd\fP is installed.
